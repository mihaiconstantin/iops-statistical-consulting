## Project 5

**Name researcher:** Pytsje Hoekstra
**Department:** Parasitology
**Faculty or Company:** LUMC

**What is topic of your research project / what is the research question?** (max 6 lines)

The topic of the RePST study is diagnosis and treatment of schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease, mainly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa. The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of praziquantel treatment for clearing Schistosoma mansoni infections in a multiple dose regimen (standard dose, four times, two-week intervals) using the KK technique. Secondary objectives include determining the efficacy of PZQ for clearing Schistosoma mansoni infections in a multiple dose regimen using DNA- and antigendetection techniques, evaluation the safety of PZQ and determining the accuracy of the different diagnostic tests used in this study. Exploratory objectives include modelling the effect of multiple PZQ treatments on the transmission of schistosomiasis as well as modelling the biological effects of multiple PZQ treatments on individual worm burden, egg load and re-infection rates.

**What statistical question(s) do you want to pose to the students?**

The specific research question for this student project would be to determine the accuracy of the different diagnostic methods that are used within the project. Please shortly describe the data source(s) available (number of subjects, number of variables): 167 participants, divided into two groups (not equal), followed weekly over a period of 10 weeks. Some missing data at each time point. Four different diagnostic methods are applied. Microscopy (performed in the field in Côte d’Ivoire) and PCR on stool samples (ongoing at LUMC), and a rapid antigen detection test (field) and a lab-based antigen test (LUMC) on urine samples. Stool sample data bi-weekly, and urine sample data weekly. If known already, would you like to perform particular statistical techniques on the data (e.g, machine learning, mixed models, survival analysis, meta-analysis)? As we already indicated in the published study protocol, we would like to perform latent class analysis on the data.
